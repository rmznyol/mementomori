# mementomori
Project: Team Memento Mori created a binary classifier to predict whether an U.S. citizen will die of an unnatural cause versus a natural cause.  Unnatural causes of death are classified as those falling into the categories of all-cause accidents, homicides, and suicides, while natural causes make up the remaining causes.  The team used publicly-available Multiple Cause Mortality Data from the Center for Disease Control collected each year from 2005 to 2015.  These data consist of demographic and all-cause mortality information for every death in the United States, totalling about 2.7 million deaths each year.
